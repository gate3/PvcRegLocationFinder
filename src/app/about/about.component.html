                    <h2>About The App</h2>

                    <p>Hello, I'm Doyin Olarewaju Full stack web dev with a passion for javascript and I made this app.</p>
                    <p>I've been slacking on doing my TVC for a while now, been postponing without no particular reason and my latest excuse has been that i don't even know where to do it. I asked around and realized that a lot of people where having thesame issue around me. So i decided to make this small utility to help people find locations around where they can do the registration for their voters card.</p>

                    <p><b>But a job of this magnitude needs some help. I cannot add all the locations alone. If everybody can just take a moment to add one or two locations around them, we will have all the locations on record in no time.</b></p>
                    
                    <p>The app is open source and PR's are welcome. You can also use as you wish, but kindly reference me. A few good words will go a long way to lift of the spirit.</p>
