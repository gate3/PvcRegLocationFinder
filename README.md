# Pvc Location Finder

This is open source project that helps find locations where you can register for your voters registration card for the 2019 Nigerian Elections.

# Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need to have npm installed. You can do that by installing [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installing

### Clone the project

Use git clone to get a copy of the project from your terminal/command prompt. Use cd/PvcRegLocationFinder to get into the project directory. Run npm install to install its dependencies. 

### Download as zip

Download the project as a zip file and unzip it into a location of your choice. Use cd/PvcRegLocationFinder to get into the project directory. Run npm install to install its dependencies.

## Configuration

I didn't commit my database credentials with the project (obviously). You need to obtain your firebase credentials then rename src/environments_sample to src/environments. I already created the object for the required environment variables just fill them in accordingly.

## What's next
